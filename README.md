# üöñ Car Showroom VR üöî

The Car Showroom VR project stems from a prototype I developed during the [Pair Programming DRD (Defend, Run, Display)](https://github.com/KateBiel/2022DEVF3_XTR_PairProgrammingDRD/blob/main/README.md) exercises. The overarching aim was to transfer the prototype to virtual reality while capitalizing on insights from prior sessions and lectures. 

Game Description: The player's journey begins at a car shop. They can customize their future car's appearance, even transforming it into an ambulance or a police car. After selecting their preferred style, the player can take it for a spin around town. This test drive allows them to experience their car in action and explore the town from the driver's seat.

> [!NOTE]
>My "Original Version" served as the primary submission, encapsulating my early efforts. Yet, upon wrapping up my academic term, I felt a pull towards refining this endeavor further. The allure of the customization feature, enriched by an array of new insights and a bit more free time, spurred me to enhance aspects I had initially sidestepped.

<summary><h2> Design Process </h2></summary>

For Car Models, I chose to experiment with a different modeling software called [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/). After some research, I discovered that it's highly recommended for voxel modeling, which was exactly what I was looking for.

Below is an overview of my working process in Blockbench.

For Level Environment, I used assets from the Unity Asset Store and Sketchfab. However, I made modifications to them in Blender and also crafted new textures. The aim was to ensure variety while maintaining consistency with the original style.

List  of Assets:
  
* [Simple Town Lite - Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/simple-town-lite-cartoon-assets-43480)
* [Mr. Noodles - Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/mr-noodles-d24fdce023a649aa9b198d56de9ccdf1)
* [Shark Ebisu - Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/shark-ebisu-ac7089c0a160484cbfa8849d6fbc3cfc)

 <h2>There is Always Room for Improvements!!!</h4>


- Improve button and slider interactions. At present, button selections lack visual feedback. Additionally, sliders are too closely positioned. 

- Enrich the driving experience. The current version lacks engagement during the drive; it's mainly looking around. Introducing interactive elements might captivate users more.

- Incorporate audio elements, such as city ambience or car engine noises. Contemplating the addition of a car radio for players to tune into during their ride can be an immersive touch.

- Introduce more animation elements, like NPCs in motion, to add life to the environment.

 <h2>Reflection</h4>


I never truly believed I could create something in virtual reality, but against my own expectations, I succeeded. The unwavering support from my peers and instructors made the implementation of the XR Interaction Toolkit a smooth experience for me.

Revisiting this project after my term concluded, I noticed numerous mistakes I'd made earlier in the code. This retrospection allowed me to refine the development aspect of the project.

I don't plan to continue developing this project or address all the points I've outlined. Instead, I'll use this experience as valuable learning material for upcoming projects. I firmly believe the mechanics I've mastered and incorporated here can extend beyond games, potentially addressing real-life challenges or enhancing people's lives.
